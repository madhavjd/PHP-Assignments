    <h2>01 What Is Object Oriented Programming? </h2>
    <p>Object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.</p>

    <h2>02 What Are Properties Of Object Oriented Systems? </h2>
    <p>basically oops stands on 4 pillars</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Encapsulation</li>
        <li>Inheritance</li>
        <li>Polymorphism</li>
        <li>Abstaction</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>03 What Is Difference Between Class And Interface? </h3>
    <p> A class can inherit another class while interface cannot inherit another class</p>

    <h2>04 What Is Overloading?</h2>
     <p>Overloading in PHP provides means to dynamically create properties and methods. 
        These dynamic entities are processed via magic methods one can establish in a class for various action types.</p>

    <h2>05 What Is T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM (Scope Resolution Operator (::)) with Example </h2>
    <p>the Scope Resolution Operator (also called Paamayim Nekudotayim) or in simpler terms, the double colon,
         is a token that allows access properties of a class without declaring  object. </p>

     <h2>06 What are the differences between abstract classes and interfaces?</h2>
     <p>The Abstract class and Interface both are used to have abstraction. 
        An abstract class contains an abstract keyword on the declaration whereas an Interface is a sketch that is used to implement a class.</p>
    
        <h2>07 Define Constructor and Destructor?</h2>
        <p>Constructor is used to initialize an object of the class and assign values to data members corresponding to the class. 
           While destructor is used to deallocate the memory of an object of a class</p>
        
        <h2>08 How to Load Classes in PHP? </h2>
        <p>in php we can create class using <b>class</b> keyword</p>
        <p>without object of class we cnt access properties of that class</p>
        <p>object means the key for access class elements in php we can create an object using <b>new</b> keyword.</p>

        <h2>09 How to Call Parent Constructor? </h2>
        <p>In order to run a parent constructor, a call to parent::__construct() within the child constructor</p>

        <h2>10 Are Parent Constructor Called Implicitly When Create An ObjectOf Class?</h2>
        <p>Parent constructors are not called implicitly if the child class defines a constructor.</p>

        <h2>11 What Happen, If Constructor Is Defined As Private Or Protected?</h2>
        <p>A private constructor is used to prevent the direct creation of objects from the class.
           The expensive process is performed within the private constructor.
            The only way to create an instance from the class is by using a static method that creates the object only if it wasn't already created. 
        </p>
        <h2>12 What are PHP Magic Methods/Functions?List them Write program for Static Keyword in PHP?</h2>
        <p>The following method names are considered magical:
            __construct(), __destruct(), __call(), __callStatic(), __get(), __set(), __isset(), __unset(), __sleep(), __wakeup(), __serialize(), __unserialize(), __toString(), __invoke(), __set_state(), __clone(), and __debugInfo(). 
        </p>

        <h2>15 Use of The $this keyword </h2>
        <p>$this is pesudo variable refering it selfs object. We can refer data member and member function of same class and its child class </p>
